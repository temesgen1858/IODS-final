#Abstract


***

***

*Welcome to my final assignment page. In this exercise, we will investigate weather there is a statistically significant relationship among per capita crime rate (in 506 towns in Boston ,USA), percentage of lower status of the population in the towns, and  full-value property-tax rate per $10,000. Related to the research question, three hypothesis are stated as follows:

*Hypothesis 1: Increase in the index of accessibility to radial highways in towns favors high crime rate*

*Hypothesis 2: Crime rates increase with high percentage of lower status of population* 

*Hypothesis 3: Crime rates inrease in rich towns as indicated by their high property tax rate* 

*To test these hypothesis, I will use linear and logistic regression analysis using Boston data from the MASS package*

*Moreover, dimensionality of the original Boston data will be reduced using principal component anlysis at later section(see PCA)*
